# surf-log-template

This is the blog template generated by Next.JS

# Before start
## 1. Set env as yours

On `.env.production` file, I recommend to change `PAGE_API_PRE_URL` and `HOST_URL` env variables as your domain.

## 2. Set homepage of package.json

If you want to use sitemap.xml properly, I recommend you to modify `homepage` value of package.json as your domain host.
